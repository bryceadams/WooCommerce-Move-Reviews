Move Your Product Reviews from One Product to Another Product!

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Move Reviews** will add a small metabox to the Edit Review page in WordPress, where you'll be able to choose a different Product to 'move' the review to.

This can be pretty handy if for some reason you want a new product to have the old reviews from another product.

You can find the review edit page either by:

* Going to the Product Edit Page and at the bottom 'editing' the single review.
* In the **Comments** area (on the back-end), finding it there and editing the single review from there.

== Installation ==

I'll make this as simple as possible.

1. Either download the plugin and upload it or search for it under **Plugins > Add New**. Activate it, too.
2. Be awesome!
